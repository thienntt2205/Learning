### Prepare plan for iteration 2

- End current Iteration 1
  - Check the current progress team
    - Issues:
      - User story point:
        - CLV has too few User story point
        - Gabriel has too many task
      - Teammate may not adapt well with changes on Jira in this iteration
        - idea:
          - I need to inform and take care everyone in dev team better
          - Need to raise the issue earlier
  - Check tasks status
    - If not done, What blocks them,
      - if it's reasonable, comment, move to the next Iteration
      - If it does not make sense, try to figure it out and help.

Â - Prepare for review/Retrospective meeting
    - About the review meeting, I think we are doing well because devs and Po cooperate really good. Po is already catch-up with devs work.
    - Retrospective meeting
      - Collect feedback from everyone on how Jira change affects their work?
      - Try to help everyone clear with the process, and suggest some new ideas to improvement if possible

- Prepare for Iteration 2
  
  - Discuss with team to have adjustments if necessary
    - Check current Assignee, progress, and overall plan for each package
    - Clarify with PO to finalize tasks
    - Encourage dev team to pick tasks, share their issues...
  - About tasks have review require from the hub team
    - Discuss with team to finalize, arrange a time, announce to hub team  to let them allocate time
