- Prepare for Iteration 2

  - Discuss with team to have adjustments if necessary
    - Check current Assignee, progress, and overall plan for each package
    - Clarify with PO to finalize tasks
    - Encourage dev team to pick tasks, share their issues...
  - About tasks have review require from the hub team
    - Discuss with team to finalize, arrange a time, announce to hub team to let them allocate time

Check all packages,

- Understand: where are we now? Current progress, what next step.
- If they need some ajustment like need more subtask related to review, testing, deploy
- Try to annouce with hub team ASAP 1st week
- We trying to reduce subtask, if not really need, we can skip clone task and stick to work log feature

Iteration objectives
1. Deploy to production: Allocation, Bottleneck, Snapshot Forecast
2. Deploy to staging : BSA, Standby
3. Kick start: draft design for COA, COP
