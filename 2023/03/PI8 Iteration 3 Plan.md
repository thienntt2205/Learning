**Dev Work Load status**

| Assignee | Total User story point |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| Gabriel  | 14.25                  |
| Robert   | 7                      |
| Alex     | 9.5                    |
| Hutson   | 9.25                   |
| Quin     | 7.5                    |

## Situation summary

- Because we have some pending tasks from prev iteration move to the current. Then when they combined with the planned task, it's cause overload for several members like Gabriel, Robert, Trisha (18 points). CLV Assignment is currently ok.

- Solution

  - Contacting with Trisha and Gabriel to verify and help them solving overload status (if needed)

## Risk

- We still have many review task depend on Hub schedule. It may impact our whole plan
- In case, We have to reorganize task for the remaining iteration
