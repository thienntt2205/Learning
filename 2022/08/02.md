After the discussion, I would like share the summary:

1. Please send us the public API's name which OPUS calls
2. Here is APIs logic

- Return result: 200: - Successfully create notification + Booking no ex: ("err_msg":"Successfully create (Booking: BKG_NO, Standby Result SEQ: SB_RSLT_SEQ)"
- Priority api will refer to Priority Type Cypher.docx
- Sequential api will refer to Sequential Type Cypher\_FREC06233400.docx
- Input Json will be the same as we discuss before on question file.

Feel free to reach us if there any issues
