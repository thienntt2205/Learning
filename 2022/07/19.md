  - Join Condition
    - The CARTESIAN JOIN or CROSS JOIN
      - Returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from two or more joined tables. Thus, it equates to an inner join where the join-condition always evaluates to either True or where the join-condition is absent from the statement.
      - Equijoins
        - An equijoin is such a join which performs against a join condition containing an equality operator. It combines rows of one table associated with one or more rows in another table based on the equality of column values or expressions.
        -
        ```
        SELECT column_list
        FROM table1, table2
        WHERE table1.column_name =
        table2.column_name;
        ```
    - The SQL NATURAL JOIN
      - Is a type of EQUI JOIN and is structured in such a way that, columns with the same name of associated tables will appear once only.
  - In precedence of set operators the expression is evaluated from: Left to right
