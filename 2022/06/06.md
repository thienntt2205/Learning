- Oracle SQL
  - [MERGE](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/statements_9017.htm#SQLRF01606)
    - Purpose
      - Use the MERGE statement to select rows from one or more sources for update or insertion into a table or view. You can specify conditions to determine whether to update or insert into the target table or view.
      - This statement is a convenient way to combine multiple operations. It lets you avoid multiple INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE DML statements.
      - MERGE is a deterministic statement. You cannot update the same row of the target table multiple times in the same MERGE state
    - Syntax:
      - merge::=
      ` You must specify at least one of the clauses merge_update_clause or merge_insert_clause.`
